## Git Layout
The git repository contains the project folder and a README file. The default branch is called main as is the latest convention.

## Version Control Approach 
During development, I commit when a body of work was completed. It is important that the application can be run without error regardless of which commit is pulled. 
Branches were created when working on complex new features, such as when I was implementing the user permissions dialog, where I need to commit. I find it easier and cleaner than rolling back to a previous commit. As I was the only developer working on this project, I decided to merge and rebase in order to keep the commit history on the main branch clear to understand.

## Data Structures 
There are three primary data structures used in this program. They are users, groups, channels. Users is an array that consists of a user object. A user has an id, username, email address and a role. Groups is an array that consist of a group object. A group has a group name. Each group contains Channel. Channels is an array that consist of a channel object. A channel has a channel name and User. Users is an array that consist of a username object.

{group: number, channel: [
	{nameChannel: string, user: [
		username,â€¦]
]}

# Angular Architecture
## Components
### Login
It consists of a simple login form with an input for username, password and a submit button. When the submit button is clicked it calls the login function, which makes an HTTP POST request to /login with the username and password. If the response returns ok: [user] then returned user data is set as user in localStorage, a function is called with the return value of what is stored in user in localStorage and the application navigates to the page that corresponding to role of user. If the response returns ok: false, then the local error variable is set to true which displays a hint on the frontend stating the username or password is incorrect.

### Role of user setting options
Options |	Technical | Explanation	Permission | Required	| Applies to

### Deleting User
If the current user role is not 'super' then the delete buttons are hint.
If the user is 'super', then clicking the delete button will call the removeUser function which makes HTTP POST request to /removeUser and the users local variable is set to the returned users and priority is set for users.
